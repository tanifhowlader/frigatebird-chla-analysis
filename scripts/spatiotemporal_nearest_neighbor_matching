This script based on a NASA ARSET tutorial, performs a full pipeline for enriching animal tracking data with remotely sensed 
environmental information â€” specifically, appending chlorophyll-a concentrations to each frigatebird GPS location using spatiotemporal nearest-neighbor matching.

# Purpose

Append MODIS-derived chlorophyll-a values to frigatebird GPS tracking points, using:

Temporal matching to the closest chlorophyll observation date

Spatial nearest-neighbor matching based on geographic proximity

# Loading Required Packages

library(dplyr)        # Data manipulation
library(lubridate)    # Date handling
library(FNN)          # Fast nearest-neighbor search
library(ggplot2)      # Visualization

Loading Input Data

frigatebird.tracks <- readRDS(".../frigatebird_tracks_with_chla.rds")

Loads your GPS tracking data.

Assumes a separate data frame chl_tidy is already available, created using rerddapXtracto::tidy_grid(), containing chlorophyll data with columns: longitude, latitude, Date, and chlorophyll.


# Alligning Each GPS Timestamp to the Nearest Chlorophyll Date

mutate(Date = chl_dates[which.min(abs(as.numeric(as.Date(Timestamp) - chl_dates)))])

Finds the closest available chlorophyll-a date to each GPS point.

Stores this as a new Date column, enabling exact temporal joins.

# Filtering and Sorting Datasets for Matching

track_filtered <- ... 
chl_filtered <- ...

Ensures that only matching dates are retained.

Sorts the data to maintain consistent indexing for later merging.

# Nearest-Neighbor Matching (Spatial Join)
nn_idx <- get.knnx(data = chl_coords, query = track_coords, k = 1)$nn.index

For each date:

Extracts bird and chlorophyll coordinates for that day.

Finds the nearest chlorophyll grid cell (in space) using fast k-nearest neighbors (k = 1).

Appends the corresponding chlorophyll value to each GPS point.

# Merging Back into Original Dataset
frigatebird.tracks$chla[track_rows] <- track_filtered$chla
Inserts matched chla values into the full tracking dataset.


# Checking and Saving Output

summary(frigatebird.tracks$chla)
saveRDS(frigatebird.tracks, "frigatebird_tracks_with_chla_final.rds")

Confirms the presence and distribution of chlorophyll values.

Saves the enriched dataset for future use.

# Optional Visualization

ggplot(...) + facet_wrap(~ TagLocalIdentifier)

Creates a faceted scatterplot of bird locations, colored by log-transformed chlorophyll-a.

Helps visualize how bird behavior relates to ocean productivity.



frigatebird.tracks$chla[track_rows] <- track_filtered$chla




WHY THIS WORKFLOW MATTERS
Enables spatiotemporal integration of biological and environmental data.

Provides a foundation for habitat modeling, behavioral ecology, or climate response analysis.

The nearest-neighbor approach allows environmental context to be added without requiring raster extraction tools.
