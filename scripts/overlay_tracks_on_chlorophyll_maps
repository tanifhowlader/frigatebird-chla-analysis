To determine whether your tracking data in "C:/Users/Tanif/Downloads/Frigatebird_evars/frigatebird_tracks_cleaned.rds" can be overlaid on the chlorophyll data, we need to check for compatibility on three main criteria:

# Loading and Inspecting Tracking Data
# Load the RDS file
frigatebird.tracks <- readRDS("C:/Users/Tanif/Downloads/Frigatebird_evars/frigatebird_tracks_cleaned.rds")

# Peek at the structure
str(frigatebird.tracks)

# Check date range and coordinate ranges
summary(frigatebird.tracks$Timestamp)
summary(frigatebird.tracks$LocationLat)
summary(frigatebird.tracks$LocationLong)

# Compare with Chlorophyll Data
From the NetCDF output:

Latitude range: 3.175 to 7.775°N

Longitude range: –164.675 to –159.25°E

Time range: 2022-06-15 to 2023-03-16

Now compare:

Are the lat/lon values in the tracks within those bounds?

Do timestamps fall between 2022-06-15 and 2023-03-16?
If yes, the tracking data is compatible and can be overlaid. 


SPATIAL COMPATIBILITY

Based on the output the tracking data is fully compatible with the chlorophyll-a data downloaded. 
| Variable      | Tracking Range    | Chlorophyll Range    | ✅ Compatible?                            |
| ------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Latitude**  | 3.166° – 7.777°   | 3.175° – 7.775°      | ✅ Yes — slight edge cases are acceptable |
| **Longitude** | –164.7° – –159.3° | –164.675° – –159.25° | ✅ Yes — full overlap                     |

The latitude minimum (3.166) is just below the chlorophyll range (3.175), but this likely overlaps within rounding tolerance of the dataset grid (0.025° resolution).

Longitude and most latitudes fall well within the chlorophyll coverage.



TEMPORAL COMPATIBILITY

| Variable      | Tracking Range                | Chlorophyll Range              | ✅ Compatible?            |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| **Timestamp** | June 1, 2022 – March 28, 2023 | June 15, 2022 – March 16, 2023 | ✅ Yes (majority overlap) |



Some tracking points occur before chlorophyll starts (e.g., early June 2022) and after it ends (late March 2023).

These extra dates will simply return NA during extraction — this is expected behavior.

We could safely overlay these frigatebird tracks on your chlorophyll data and:

Visualize where birds travel relative to ocean productivity.

Extract and analyze chlorophyll values at bird locations.

Perform spatiotemporal modeling or habitat preference studies.
