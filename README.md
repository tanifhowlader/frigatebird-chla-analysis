# frigatebird-chla-analysis
Using chlorophyll-a data with GPS tracks of frigatebirds using MODIS and ERDDAP in R


# Frigatebird Movement and Chlorophyll-a Integration

This project enriches GPS tracking data of frigatebirds with satellite-derived environmental dataâ€”specifically **chlorophyll-a concentration**â€”to explore the ecological drivers of seabird behavior over time and space. The workflow was developed for training purposes in NASA's ARSET program and is compatible with MODIS Aqua daily chlorophyll datasets accessed via ERDDAP.

---

## Objectives

- Download chlorophyll-a data from the ERDDAP server (MODIS Aqua, daily).
- Match remotely sensed data with animal tracking locations based on space and time.
- Visualize enriched tracks to explore ecological patterns.
- Create a reusable and reproducible workflow using open data and R.

---

## Data Sources

### 1. **Frigatebird Tracking Data**
- Format: `.rds`
- Contents: Cleaned GPS telemetry (timestamp, lat/lon, bird ID)
- Source: Provided externally, not included due to data privacy

### 2. **Chlorophyll-a Concentration**
- Source: MODIS Aqua daily product via ERDDAP
- Dataset ID: `erdMBchlamday_LonPM180`
- Accessed via `rerddap` and `rerddapXtracto` packages

---

## Required R Packages

```r
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(viridis)
library(rerddap)
library(rerddapXtracto)
library(raster)
library(lubridate)
library(sp)


# Install missing packages:
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "viridis", "raster", "lubridate", "sp"))
# Use remotes::install_github() if rerddapXtracto is not on CRAN

Workflow Overview
| Step | Description                                                         |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Load cleaned GPS tracking data                                      |
| 2    | Define spatial and temporal extents                                 |
| 3    | Download and process chlorophyll-a from ERDDAP                      |
| 4    | Create a raster stack of chlorophyll data                           |
| 5    | Match track points to environmental conditions by date and location |
| 6    | Append chlorophyll-a values to each GPS point                       |
| 7    | Save enriched dataset and visualize                                 |
