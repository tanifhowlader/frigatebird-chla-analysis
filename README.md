# frigatebird-chla-analysis
Using chlorophyll-a data with GPS tracks of frigatebirds using MODIS and ERDDAP in R


# Frigatebird Movement and Chlorophyll-a Integration

This project enriches GPS tracking data of frigatebirds with satellite-derived environmental dataâ€”specifically **chlorophyll-a concentration**â€”to explore the ecological drivers of seabird behavior over time and space. The workflow was developed for training purposes in NASA's ARSET program and is compatible with MODIS Aqua daily chlorophyll datasets accessed via ERDDAP.

---

## Objectives

- Download chlorophyll-a data from the ERDDAP server (MODIS Aqua, daily).
- Match remotely sensed data with animal tracking locations based on space and time.
- Visualize enriched tracks to explore ecological patterns.
- Create a reusable and reproducible workflow using open data and R.

## Data Description
Raw Data Source
All frigatebird tracking data originate from:
Movebank: DataOne Repository - 10.24431/rw1k8ez
This dataset includes GPS tracking of Great Frigatebirds (Fregata minor) in the Pacific Ocean, deployed with E-Obs tags and archived in Movebank.

frigatebird_tracks_cleaned.rds
Description: Cleaned version of the raw GPS data from the Movebank archive.

Contents: A dataframe containing timestamped locations (Timestamp, LocationLat, LocationLong) and metadata (e.g., TagLocalIdentifier).

Processing: Unreliable records with missing or duplicated coordinates were removed; timestamps were formatted into POSIXct. No environmental variables are appended yet.

frigatebird_tracks_combined.rds
Description: This version may combine multiple cleaned GPS datasets from different deployments or tags into a single master file.

Contents: A merged dataset of multiple birds with standardized field names and consistent time zones.

Purpose: Useful for performing cross-individual comparisons or large-scale spatial analysis.

chlorophyll_download.nc
Description: A NetCDF file containing daily surface chlorophyll-a concentrations over the spatial and temporal extent of the frigatebird tracks.

Source: MODIS Aqua ocean color dataset via the ERDDAP server (erdMBchlamday_LonPM180).

Download Method: Downloaded using the rxtracto_3D() function from the rerddapXtracto R package, specifying the bounding box and date range of the bird movements.

Usage: Used as an input to spatially extract chlorophyll values at each GPS point using the raster::extract() function.

frigatebird_tracks_with_chla.rds
Description: Final enriched tracking dataset, with chlorophyll-a concentrations appended to each bird location.

Contents: All columns from the cleaned dataset plus a new column: chla (chlorophyll-a concentration at that location and month).

Processing Steps:

Each GPS point was matched to a raster layer by month (MonthDate).

The chlorophyll value was extracted from the MODIS raster stack (chlorophyll_download.nc) using the bird's latitude and longitude.

Results were added to the frigatebird.tracks dataframe.
